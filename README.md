# What is this?

This repository is the documentation for the open source project Gogs.

## What is Gogs?
Gogs allows you to deploy a local Git server for a single machine or a small network. It lets you clone and push code using HTTP and SSH protocols, and provides a nice web UI with common features such as Pull Requests and Issues.

## Contributing

Fork, update and submit a pull request. No matter how big or small, your changes are welcome!

## How it works

The Gogs web server checks for updates to this project and updates the main documentation automatically.

## Formatting

Gogs documentation is written using standard [markdown syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/). Please submit your changes using the same syntax.
